You
're building a multi-tenant school management system which will be used as backend. Attached is my firebase configuration for this app i\'ve created in firebase. You are to decide the file/folder structure of the app, so you decide what feature or what part of the app should be on separate files...its better to have them on separate files, so you\'re to do the appropriate imports of each files where necessary. Assuming the name of my app/website is "SchoolManagementSystem.com". The idea is that school owners/administrator visits my website and create account...so only created admin accounts can manage their respective school from their dashboard eg. add students, teachers, parents, class, sessions etc....so if doable, you,re creating the marketing page for schoolmanagementsystem.com, with  sign up button for admins and login page for both admins and his created users and then the main app itself. I want dynamic, beautiful fluid like with moderate, beautiful modern animation where possible.
